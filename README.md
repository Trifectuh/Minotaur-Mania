# Minotaur Mania!
Bastard of man and bull, you’ve been exiled to a remote labyrinth in Crete. A freak, a menace, an outcast.

Your appearance may seem bestial, but your heart

…is human.

The Gods have shown mercy, giving you the chance to reclaim your humanity by consuming the sacrifices and heroes tossed before you.

But even more, the chance to reign over the very people that made you an outcast…

## How To Play
#### Keys

* Arrow keys - Move yourself toward those sacrificed to your labyrinth.
* Z - Swing your giant frickin’ axe at ‘em.
NOTE: A and B are Z and X on the keyboard!

#### Goal

Consume all the sacrifices sent into your labyrinth before they escape!
